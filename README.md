### Q.2 Project Description: ###

The User Biodata Program is a Java program that prompts users to input their biodata information, 
including their first name, surname, middle name, department, level, age, phone number, and gender. The 
program then prints out the user's gender as either "Male," "Female," or "Unspecified gender." This 
program was developed as part of the course requirements for COS 201.
Programming Concepts Used:
1. Variables: In this program, different variables were declared and used to store various data types such 
as strings, integers, longs, and characters.
2. Input/Output: The Scanner class in Java was used to allow users to input their biodata information into 
the program while the System.out.println() method was used to output the data on the console.
3. Data Types: Various data types were used to store different kinds of information. For instance, the 
String data type was used to store names while the int data type was used to store numerical values.
4. Conditional Statements: The switch statement was used in this program to compare the user's input 
character to known values and print out the corresponding gender.
Challenges Faced:
One main challenge faced during the development of this program was handling errors that could occur 
when the user inputs incorrect data types. For example, if a user enters a string where an integer is 
expected, it will result in an error. It can also be challenging to handle unexpected behavior such as a user 
entering negative numbers for their age or phone number. Another challenge faced was writing clean and 
efficient code that follows programming best practices.
How Challenges Were Overcome:
To overcome the issue of handling input errors, we added validation checks to ensure that the user inputs 
the correct data type. For example, we employed the try-catch block to catch exceptions that might arise 
from parsing a string into an integer. Additionally, we included checks to confirm that the user's input for 
age and phone number were not negative. 
To overcome the challenge of writing clean and efficient code, we ensured that we followed programming 
best practices such as using meaningful variable names to make the code more readable and 
understandable. We also made sure that the code was well-structured and commented where necessary.
Conclusion:
The User Biodata Program is a simple yet useful program that allows users to input their biodata 
information. Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in programming concepts such as 
variables, input/output, data types, and conditional statements. The challenges encountered during the 
development of this program allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts and how they 
can be applied in real-life situations. Overall, this project provided us with valuable insights into the world 
of programming and enabled us to further develop our programming skills.
